# Feature Selection method in MLR3 Framework

This repository contains methods and examples for feature selection using the mlr3 framework in R. It provides a structured approach to selecting the most relevant features for machine learning models.

## Overview

Feature selection is a critical step in machine learning pipeline development. This repository demonstrates various feature selection techniques implemented with the mlr3 ecosystem, helping you improve model performance and interpretability by identifying the most important features in your datasets.

## Installation

To use this repository, you need to install the required R packages:

```r
# Install mlr3 and related packages
install.packages(c("mlr3", "mlr3learners", "mlr3filters", "mlr3pipelines", "mlr3tuning"))

# For visualization
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "gridExtra"))

# Clone this repository
# git clone https://github.com/mutahikiboi/Feature_selection_mlr3.git
```

## Key Features

- **Filter Methods**: Implementation of various filter methods including information gain, correlation, and variance-based selection
- **Wrapper Methods**: Feature selection using recursive feature elimination and forward selection
- **Embedded Methods**: Feature importance extraction from models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting
- **Visualization Tools**: Functions to visualize feature importance and selection results
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Comparing model performance before and after feature selection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Selection with Filter Methods

```r
library(mlr3)
library(mlr3filters)
library(mlr3learners)

# Create a task
task = TaskClassif$new("example", iris, "Species")

# Apply filter method
filter = flt("information_gain")
filter$calculate(task)
head(as.data.table(filter), 3)
```

### Feature Selection Pipeline

```r
library(mlr3pipelines)

# Create a feature selection pipeline
selector = po("filter", filter = flt("information_gain"), filter.nfeat = 2)
learner = lrn("classif.rpart")
pipe = selector %>>% learner
pipe_learner = GraphLearner$new(pipe)

# Train and evaluate
result = resample(task, pipe_learner, rsmp("cv", folds = 5))
result$aggregate()
```
